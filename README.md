# Emoji Bash Prompt

This friendly little bash configuration will change your bash prompt to display a pair of emojis depending on the time of day
(and the day of the week). It'll remind you to eat a healthy breakfast in the morning, work hard during the day, relax
in the evening, and get a good night's rest.

## Install - Option 1

Move this repository to your home directory (~), and add the following line to your ~/.bash_profile or
~/.profile:

```bash
source ~/.bash_custom/bash_emojis
```

## Install - Option 2

Copy the contents of .bash\_emojis to ~/.bash\_profile or ~/.profile. Make sure that there aren't any lines below that
modify the PS1 environment variable (this defines the bash prompt).
